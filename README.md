# RobotPlayero-MO69

In this project you will find the files for raspberry pi pico and arduino nano, to control, read and send data to each other.

For raspberry pi pico:
  DCMOTOR: Module for the control of two pololu 70:1 Metal Gearmotor 37Dx54L mm 12V (Spur Pinion) motors with BTS7960 H-bridge drivers.
  Prueba_ModuloDCmotor: Code to test the DCMOTOR Module.

For arduino nano:
  SensorPlayero: Code for reading and sending data via UART protocol from five E18d80nk proximity sensors and one MPU6050 sensor.
